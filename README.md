# key-value-db
In this project we will be creating a simple version of a distributed, fault-tolerant, Key-Value (KV) database (or store), with a few tweaks. From Wikipedia: a key–value database, or key–value store, is a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, and a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash table. Dictionaries contain a collection of objects, or records, which in turn have many different fields within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a key that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to find the data within the database. In our case, we will be using a Trie instead of a hash table for storing the keys.
